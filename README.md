<h2>System Overview</h2>
<p>
OneMenu is a web application which uses a collection of real menu data, crowdsourced by its users, in order to compile a list of all nearby fast food and traditional restaurant options. It gives the users the ability to compare prices between any number of restaurants, as well as sort and search through them all in a singular location. This saves the user a lot of time by substituting for the traditional methods of searching for something to eat, in which the user would have to traverse multiple restaurantsâ€™ websites at once. Often, prices are not listed since they vary by location, so this poses yet another issue in the traditional iterations of online menus.

With OneMenu, once a user visits a restaurant, they may leave a review to inform other users of their experience, as well as update the price currently in the system. This potentially allows users to collaborate in a way which keeps the website up to date and current, and saves restaurants the trouble of having to manually go online and update their menu prices for each location. If they are priced competitively, users will be able to see this in the singular menu provided, in which the user may directly compare the same menu option from multiple different restaurants. All menu information was inputted manually, using real-life menus from restaurants in the Baton Rouge area. A user may also update the menu at any time if they find something new on the menu, giving OneMenu a dynamic, user-friendly experience.

This was implemented as a three-tier web application, separating the front-end, server logic, and backend database. The application was deployed on 2 separate Amazon EC2 instances
